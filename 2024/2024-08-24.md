I'm reading *The Three-Body Prolem* series and I'm really enjoying it. The scale is really big. I mean, most of SF books have large scales, because they usually talk about the space.
However this book is about much larger than that. The scale of the space that the book talks about is large and the topics are also various. 
The series has three books and the first book talks about history of China, and the second book talks about the *axioms* of living creatures, and I'm reading the third book and it seems like the main theme is love.

I'm not a book worm, but I recently read some sci-fi books, mostly 김초엽's books. But this book is just another level. I was impressed by the ingenuity of the story for multiple time while reading it.
The author is genious for sure.

I hightly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun and long story.
And also thanks to Netflix. I learned about the book through Netflix, although I didn't watch the show.

By the way, hard science come up often in the book. I don't know how much is non-fictional facts, but they sound serious.
You might think you need to understand everything, but you don't have to get the pressure. You don't have to. So bear with it and you will meet a wonderful story.
