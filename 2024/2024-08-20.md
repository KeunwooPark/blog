title: Problems of Typescript and Javascript
tags: development

Nothing is perfect. I know. I like JS and TS. However, there is one thing that I don't understand, which is that compiler (transpiler, precisely) options are exposed to the developers. I mean, too much.
It is mendatory for the developers to carefully control the transpiler configurations, such as Babel, Rollup, tsconfig, and etc.
You might not have to touch the configurations when running a simple script. However, when you start to do more serious things, like creating a package for another project, you might have to wrestle with the config files.

I always had to do the *configuration circus* whenever I start new js project, which in my opinion, doesn't make sense. As I know, Java, Python, Ruby, and C++ doesn't have such a problem.
Developer can choose a compiler for these languages, but at least it is not mendatory.

I hope this problem would be solved in the near future.
