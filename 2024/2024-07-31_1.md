I like Simone Giertz. I liked her contents about silly robots. More intersting thing was what she started her own business and I always was curious about how she is running the business.
She started her career with something far from business, but why did she started a company and how it is earning money?

[This video](https://youtu.be/iEAShZ8TJCs?si=YOPwBDR_-IWPbaKf) answers my quetions. She says doing a hardware business is hard. But also it seems really fun and interesting.
It was suprising that her company works in full-remote environment.

Starting a hardware company is my old dream. When can I start?
