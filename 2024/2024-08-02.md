title: Travari book club - what is good design?
tags: design, book

Recently, I participated in a book club through Travari, a company that organizes book clubs.
The topic was `What is good design?' It is an ambitious and intriguing topic.

The book club was held every fourth Sunday of a month, four times in total.
A club leader prepares topics related to the book, and we discuss the issues in the sessions.

We read the following four books.
- Inspired by Marty Cagan
- Laws of UX by Jon Yablonski
- 그렇게 쓰면 아무도 안 읽습니다. by 전주경 (only in Korean)
- 그로쓰 해킹 by 양승화 (only in Korean)

I learned a lot from this book club. It was very fun to talk with passionate people about building good products.
The club's focus was more on the products rather than pure design.
It was closer to my interest.
In this book club, I realized that I need to study and learn things that differ from academia in the industry.
Honestly, I thought academic problems were more complex than industry problems. It is true in some sense. 
However, I realized that industry problems are much more complex and have overwhelming parameters, which make it impossible to control the environment. 
They are equally difficult to solve, but in a different aspect.

I highly recommend those books to whoever is interested in making good products.

I might have to write a blog for design book recommendations.
