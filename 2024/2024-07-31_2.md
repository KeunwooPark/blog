I want to make or be part of a group that shares ideas about product design and deveopment.
The focus is on the product, which differentiates the group's charcteristics from academia.

However, I'm not sure how to set the form of the group. More precisely, I'm not sure what I want to discuss. I just want to learn new things from others.
What could the group's format that various creative ideas can spark in the group?

I made [this website](https://sundayproduct.club) to gather product people, but it is a very long term project. It could work as a seed, but not happening now.
