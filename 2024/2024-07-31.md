I'm starting another blog. I always dreamed of a very simple version of blog. Even the Wordpress seemd to bulky for me.
So I'm using GitHub as a new blog platform.

I'm not going to write a long blog. I'll rather try to write as frequent as possible. My goal is to maintain this blog as long as possible.
